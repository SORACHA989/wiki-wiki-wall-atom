Need to handle errors
Should show you errors as you type?
Bug: Too many windows and emitters apparenlty - they think it is a memory leak
It should allow you to generate all the svgs but only show the one you have selected
It would be nice if the context menu only showed up on the right kind of file.

Autocompleter - make it so it auto suggests stuff


//Tis will let you set keymaps only for certain styles
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='source js']":
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='source css']":
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='source json']":
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='text html basic']":

Markers:
  Be able to set a marker on a shape/layout
  Style the item that is marked

  Be able to remove a marker that is set on a specific item
  Ignore markers set on non shape/layout

  have a clear all button that removes all of the markers
  Have a bottom panel with a clear all button 
  The clear all button should be disabled if there are no markers
  it should be enabled if there are markers
  it should show a count of the number of markers
  There should be a special option to disable the display of the All image
  The generate should only show images for the markers that are set - or all if no markers are set


  Look at https://atom.io/packages/nav-panel - Maybe we should offer some default rules to use this

  Need to bring up a little panel at the bottom for the kind of file
  Then have buttons to do things
